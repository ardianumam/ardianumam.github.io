## Short bio
My name is Ardian Umam (禹安銳). You can call me Ardian, or 安銳 (An-Rui) in Chinese. I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecsigp.nycu.edu.tw/) at [National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/nycu/en), Taiwan, advised by [Prof. Yen-Yu Lin](https://sites.google.com/site/yylinweb/) from [VLLab](http://vllab.cs.nycu.edu.tw/) and [Prof. Jen-Hui Chuang](https://www.cs.nycu.edu.tw/members/detail/jchuang) from [Islab](http://islab.cs.nctu.edu.tw/joomla/). 

My reseach interest areas are (but not limited to) deep learning and computer vision. In recent years, I have been working in various topics, including 3D point cloud augmentation, 3D part segmentation, unsupervised/weakly supervised segmentation, multi-modal (vision-language) recognition, optical character recognition, camera callibration and audio quality estimation. I was an intern in [Google](https://google.com) under ChromeOS Audio Team and in [ITRI](https://www.itri.org.tw/english/index.aspx) working on model compression.
